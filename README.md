# **To-Do-List**

*Exercise in JavaScript, 03/16/2017*

**By Joshua Fairchild**

### Description
This program functions as a "To-Do" list where a user can list tasks that they would like to remember to do later. The webpage is divided into two columns, "Add a Task" on the left and "Completed Tasks" on the right. "Add a Task" contains a form that prompts the user to enter a couple pieces of information about their task: a description, deadline and level of importance. Once they click "Add Task", their task will appear as a small blurb or "task item" under the form in the "To Be Completed" section. The user can input subsequent tasks and each one will push the previous tasks further down the webpage.

Each "task item" has a button that will mark the task as complete. When an item is marked as complete, it will disappear from the left side of the page and appear in the "Completed Tasks" column (the text populating the task will also ~~become struck through~~). Subsequent tasks that appear here will push previously completed tasks further down the webpage. When an item is marked complete, the button changes to a small "X" that when clicked will remove the completed task from the page entirely.
